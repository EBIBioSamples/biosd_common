1.0.4-SNAPSHOT
  - NCBI and SPINE profiles added
  - Oracle parameters moved to common POM properties, to avoud duplication
  - jutils 4.1 dependency upgrade
  
1.0.3 
  - First release, created from the rearrangement of existing packages

1.0.2 - 1.0
  - Fake releases, we needed to create these, due to tests we needed to run with Bamboo (and difficulty in removing 
    bad releases, which were actually all identical to 1.0.3).
